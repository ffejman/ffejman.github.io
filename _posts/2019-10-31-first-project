The objective of this project was to test out my scraping capablities and put what I had learned about scraping to the test! 
The tools used for this project was R and specifically the library rvest to scrape content from the web. The question I wanted to answer
using scraping was, Where are the tallest buildings in the world, and where are the biggest stadiums in the world? I then wanted to see if 
they were in similar locations.
