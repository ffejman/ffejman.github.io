The objective of this project was to test out my scraping capablities and put what I had learned about scraping to the test! 
The tools used for this project was R and specifically the library rvest to scrape content from the web. The question I wanted to answer
using scraping was, Where are the tallest buildings in the world, and where are the biggest stadiums in the world? I then wanted to see if 
they were in similar locations. The datasource I chose was the Wikipedia articles on the Worlds Tallest Buildings and the Worlds Largest Stadiums.

Below is the script I used to scape the data from the Largest Stadiums by Capacity Wikipedia page. After Scraping the data I took the top 5
uses of Stadiums in the list to see what the most common uses of large stadiums were. I then graphed results in a bargraph. Also shown below

I used similiar code to scape the page on the Tallest buildings, and then imported the data into Tablou to visualize the data on a map 
to see if they buildings and stadiums are in the same locations. These maps are shown below
